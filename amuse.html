      <h2>Sad, but Funny Laughs</h2>
      <p>In this video, Pangina Heals the drag queen artist was eliminated from Rupauls Drag Race. This was one of the most shocking eliminations because Pangina was one of the strongest competitors. This was very amusing because she sent one of the most loved drag queen home and said "thats how the game is," and then next week she got eliminated and wouldn't stop crying. (Everyone still loves Pangina and of course everyone felt bad but she got what was coming.)</p>

      <h2>Laugh out Loud Moment</h2>
      <p>In this shortened clip, the drag queens Kween Kong and Beverly Killz were lip syncing in the franchise Down Under. This was one of the most iconic lip syncs because the queens ended up doing flips and tricks which everyone was confused about... or they loved it!</p>

      <h2>Snatch Game is the Funniest</h2>
      <p>Have you ever heard of Snatch Game? It is one of the challenges the queens have to pass in Rupauls drag race, which is said to be "what makes the winners stand out from the losers." This is Baga Chipz performing an iconic snatch game as Kathy Bates. She won this challenge because of how funny it was. This clip is shortened.</p>
